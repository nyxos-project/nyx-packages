# Nyx Desktop Widgets: plugin widgets on the desktop, behind windows. The widgets
# themselves are plugins: Up next ships here, the others (clock, weather, stats, media)
# with nyx-bar, all in share/nyx/plugins. NyxOS runs the Quickshell interface:
# nyx-desktop-widgets-backend starts with the session and the component goes to
# share/nyx-shell/components, drawn by Nyx Shell's nyx-shell-qs; the GTK host stays
# installed (its unit isn't started).
